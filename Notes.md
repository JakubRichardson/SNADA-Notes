## Noise and Bandwidth

> Noise: undesirable signal perturbation, always present in communication systems. Noise is random and non-deterministic, so probabilistic (Gaussian random variable), and can be internal or external to system

### Internal Noise

Generated by components within the system, such as: resistors and active solid state devices. Internal noise is a result of the random motion of charge carriers in electronic components

Types of internal noise:

- Thermal (Johnson) noise: random motion of free electrons in a conductor or semiconductor due to thermal agitation

- Shot noise: random arrival of discrete carriers in devices like: thermionic tubes or semiconductor junction devices

- Flicker ($ \frac{1}{f} $) noise: produced in semiconductors, with strength 
inversely proportional to frequency

Noise Voltage ($ nV \sqrt{Hz} $) vs Frequency ($ Hz $) usually with log scale graph:

### External Noise

Results from sources outside of communication system such as atmospheric (thunderstorm), man-made and extra-terrestrial sources (sun...). 

#### Atmospheric Noise

- Impulsive - large amplitude for short duration bursts
- Strength inversely proportional to frequency - affects commercial AM radio (540 kHz - 1.6MHz) more than TV and FM (>50MHz)

#### Man-made Noise

Sources include: 

- High voltage power-line corona discharge
- Electric motor commutator generated noise
- Auto and aero ignition noise
- Switching gears noise
- Other radio-frequency transmitters - radio frequency interference (RFI)

#### Extra-terrestrial Noise

Sources include:

- Sun
- Stars

### Noise Calculations

Noise power for thermal/Johnson/white noise is:

$ P_n = k T \Delta f \quad (\Delta f = B) $

- $ k $ - Boltzmann's constant:  $ 1.38 \times 10^-23 $ J/K
- $ T $ - Temperature in Kelvin(K): $ K = \degree C + 273 $
- $ \Delta f $ - Bandwidth of system
