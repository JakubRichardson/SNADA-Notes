$$ \frac{1}{f} $$

## Noise and Bandwidth

> Noise: undesirable signal perturbation, always present in communication systems. Noise is random and non-deterministic, so probabilistic (Gaussian random variable), and can be internal or external to system

### Internal Noise

Generated by components within the system, such as: resistors and active solid state devices. Internal noise is a result of the random motion of charge carriers in electronic components

Types of internal noise:

- Thermal (Johnson) noise: random motion of free electrons in a conductor or semiconductor due to thermal agitation

- Shot noise: random arrival of discrete carriers in devices like: thermionic tubes or semiconductor junction devices

- Flicker ($ \frac{1}{f} $) noise: produced in semiconductors, with strength 
inversely proportional to frequency

Noise Voltage ($ nV \sqrt{Hz} $) vs Frequency ($ Hz $) usually with log scale graph:
